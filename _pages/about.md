I received my Ph.D. degree from the School of Computer Science and Engineering of South China University of Technology in 2024, with Prof. [Guihua Wen](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs/2017/0629/c22284a328095/page.htm)  as my supervisor. I received my Master degree from the Yantai University in 2021, with Associate Professor [Peng Song](https://drpengsong.github.io/) as my supervisor. I joined Ocean University of China in February 2025 as a key research postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Faculty of Information Science and Engineering of Ocean University of China, with Prof. [Yanwei Yu](https://yuyanwei.github.io/) as my supervisor. My research focuses on  affective computing, video image processing, transfer learning, and graph representation learning. I have published more than 16 papers in international journals and conferences such as NeurIPS, AAAI, IJCAI, IEEE TAFFC, IEEE TMM, IEEE TCSVT, IEEE TCDS, IEEE JBHI, Neural Networks, ESWA and ICASSP. I serve as a reviewer for journals and conferences such as IEEE TAFFC, IEEE TCSVT, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TCDS, Information Fusion, Neural Networks, ESWA, KBS, Information Sciences, and AAAI 2024.
