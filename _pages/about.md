I received my Ph.D. degree from the School of Computer Science and Engineering of South China University of Technology, with Prof. [Guihua Wen](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs/2017/0629/c22284a328095/page.htm)  as my supervisor. I received my Master degree from the School of Yantai University, with Associate Professor [Peng Song](https://drpengsong.github.io/) as my supervisor. I joined Ocean University of China in February 2025 as a key research postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Faculty of Information Science and Engineering of Ocean University of China, with Prof. [Yanwei Yu](https://yuyanwei.github.io/) as my supervisor. My research focuses onÂ  affective computing, video image processing, transfer learning, and graph representation learning. I have published more than 16 papers in international journals and conferences such as IEEE TAFFC, IEEE TMM, IEEE TCSVT, IEEE TCDS, IEEE JBHI, Neural Networks, ESWA, NeurIPS, IJCAI and ICASSP. I serve as a reviewer for journals and conferences such as IEEE TAFFC, IEEE TCSVT, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TCDS, Neural Networks, and AAAI 2024.
