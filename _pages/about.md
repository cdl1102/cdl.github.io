I received my Ph.D. from the School of Computer Science and Engineering of South China University of Technology, with Professor Wen Guihua as my supervisor. I joined Ocean University of China in February 2025 as a key research postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Faculty of Information Science and Engineering of Ocean University of China, with Professor Yu Yanwei as my co-supervisor. My research focuses onÂ  affective computing, video image processing, transfer learning, and graph representation learning. I have published more than 16 papers in international journals and conferences such as IEEE TAFFC, IEEE TMM, IEEE TCSVT, IEEE TCDS, IEEE JBHI, Neural Networks, ESWA, NeurIPS, IJCAI and ICASSP. I serve as a reviewer for journals and conferences such as IEEE TAFFC, IEEE TCSVT, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TCDS, Neural Networks, and AAAI.
